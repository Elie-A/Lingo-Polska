            "content": [
                "There are two ways 'by' behaves in Polish conditional verbs: inseparable and separable.",
                "1. Inseparable forms (one complete word):",
                "These are lexicalized forms — the conditional marker 'by' and the personal ending are fused into one word that acts as the main predicate. You cannot move or separate 'by' here.",
                "Examples:",
                "• ✅ Chcielibyśmy pojechać do Krakowa. → We would like to go to Kraków. (❌ 'Byśmy chcieli pojechać...' sounds unnatural.)",
                "• ✅ Mogłaby mi pomóc. → She could help me. (❌ 'By mogła mi pomóc' is incorrect.)",
                "Rule of thumb: If the verb (chcieć, móc, musieć, wiedzieć) expresses desire, ability, or necessity and already carries the full meaning of the main clause, then its conditional form is inseparable — it stays together as one word.",
                "2. Separable forms (movable particle 'by'):",
                "In most other cases, when 'by' forms part of a complex predicate, it is movable — it can appear right after the verb ('zrobiłbym') or before the verb ('bym zrobił'). Both are correct; placement depends on style or emphasis.",
                "Examples:",
                "• ✅ Zrobiłbym to jutro. = Bym to jutro zrobił. → I would do it tomorrow.",
                "• ✅ Powiedziałbym jej prawdę. = Bym jej prawdę powiedział. → I would tell her the truth.",
                "Rule of thumb: If the verb is an action verb (do, say, eat, go, read, etc.) and the conditional expresses a hypothetical situation, 'by' is separable.",
                "Summary Table:",
                "Type | Example | Separable? | Notes",
                "Inseparable (one word) | Chcielibyśmy, Mogłaby, Musiałbyś | ❌ No | 'by' is part of the main verb expressing wish, ability, or necessity",
                "Separable (two parts) | Zrobiłbym / Bym zrobił, Poszedłbyś / Byś poszedł | ✅ Yes | 'by' attaches to personal ending and can move for emphasis",
                "💡 Memory Tip: Think of inseparable forms as fixed verbs (like English 'would like'), and separable ones as flexible auxiliaries (like English 'would go')."
